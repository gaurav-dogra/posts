Everyday I saw my wife google

BSE Sensex
GBP to INR rate
London underground trains status
And I thought of automating this information for her. I am yet to decide how this information is presented to her. Options are
SMS
Whatsapp Message
Email
Push notifications on a mobile app
I am also hoping that others would also be interested in this service. And there is a lot of information which can be offered to subscribers, such as
Weather for the day
Matches of the day
Other stock markets
Other currencies
and so much else.....
